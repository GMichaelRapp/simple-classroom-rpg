## Welcome
This is a very light-weight roleplaying game to help students form into micro-cohorts, problem solve, develop critical thinking, and tackle important content-specific concepts. The idea first came from a very real realization in the classroom: Students don't engage with traditional lecture formats. So, to help students get away from lecture burnout, this simple roleplaying game was developed. This game is licensed under the **CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 International license** (see tabs above for details). You are free to tweak, break, or rewrite what you find here. Remember to give credit where credit is due. 

## Where to Begin
To begin, consider checking out the rules, as seen below. If you have any questions about mechanics, please consider reaching out to G. Michael Rapp at **gmichaelrapp@bitrot.xyz**. 

## What Are Strategy Roleplaying Games?
If strategy roleplaying games are new to you, they can feel daunting when attempting to tackle them as a concept. Don’t worry, though. Strategy roleplaying games are about friendly competition and constructive collaboration between allied players. While competition does exist, it is best to remember the word **collaboration** here. Collaboration is a form of entertainment, learning, and a way to produce exciting outcomes and not boring, uneventful experiences. Quite the opposite. Collaboration between teammates is the best way to develop students’ critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Collaboration is also the best way to explore a given topic in a class’s content arena, such as the cultural baggage surrounding forms of body language, the idiosyncrasies of the English language, and the strangeness of (say) modern world history. 

Two more aspects of roleplaying strategy games, aside from **competition** and **collaboration**, are **roleplaying** and **strategy**. 

In essence, roleplaying games require most individual players to take on a persona, which has been tailored for the game story or context. In this strategy roleplaying game, players, as a group, take on a persona, such as an established institution of higher learning, a small business, a sports team, a news agency, or even a national government organization. For example, Archuleta Community College (ACC), a small, rural community college nestled in the San Juan Mountains, might be a group’s persona. As ACC, we’ll use its abbreviated name, players will interact with their fellow competitors, along with the referee(s). ACC might also interact with the referee in how a situation might be roleplayed, how something might progress forward, and how challenging a given task might be. In all, players playing as ACC are indistinguishable from ACC as an institution. Everything ACC wants, the players want. Everything ACC does, the players have a hand in from the get-go. When the referee interacts with ACC, it is on the basis that the players playing ACC are acting in the interests of their institution of higher learning, Archuleta Community College. 

Strategy means thinking ahead, thinking of hiccups, or stumbling points that might lie ahead, and determining the best use of resources (i.e., Victory Tokens). In other words, strategy is more than mere competition with other players, hoping to defeat them in the game; it is about thinking forward and thinking in the long term.


## Roleplaying in an Academic Context
Roleplaying games, especially strategy roleplaying games, can provide students with ample opportunities to grow as critical thinkers, researchers, communicators, and problem solvers. These games also have the potential to help students tackle the content-specific concepts for a given class, such as their Interpersonal Communication course, their English Composition course, or even their World History course. Teachers, instructors, lecturers, and professors should see roleplaying games as an opportunity to test students’ abilities, engage with them outside of pointless lectures, and gauge student achievement and knowledge in a subject area. Roleplaying games don’t require much in the way of setup, and they don’t require much in terms of resources, as seen by this game’s short Required Materials list. What they do require is that the instructor, teacher, or whoever is in charge, is willing to be a co-learner and collaborator with their students. This will ensure success, engagement, and enriching experiences ensue. 

## Who Is the Referee (REF)?
The referee is the instructor (or T.A., professor, lecturer, etc.) who keeps order over the chaos, both in-game and in-session. The referee isn’t there to railroad results, stunt gameplay, or block constructive player-player interactions. A good referee will embrace the chaos, using rules (rather, rulings), meaningful (and constructive) player-player interactions, and specific moments in gameplay to help create an enriching experience for everyone including themselves. The referee, like the laws of physics, offers natural boundaries for acceptable gameplay and fantastic fun. Like gravity, the referee isn’t there to dole out meaningless consequences for actions (and inactions), but, rather, to make the consequences matter, make them fun, and, more importantly, make them consistent within the confines of the game’s context. 

## The Object of the Game
To win a game, a group of students must obtain _**at least**_ twenty-five (25) **Victory Tokens**. Once this victory condition has been met, the referee(s) will announce that the victory condition has been satisfied to all teams involved. All player groups begin their journey with two (2) victory tokens. Victory Tokens are awarded by the game’s referee (i.e., the instructor), who assigns tokens based on how successful a given group is when tackling certain scenarios. Extra victory tokens can be awarded based on critical successes, good roleplaying, unique problem-solving, etc. 

## Required Materials
Like many strategy roleplaying games, players will need outside materials plus what is found in this ruleset. It is recommended, for in-person games that players have the following materials on hand:
  1.	Three (3) six-sided dice
  2.	Multicolored poker chips or large plastic tokens
  3.	Pens, pencils, and highlighters
  4.	Any preparatory material provided by the instructor
  5.	Any research materials collected before the game session
  6.	Notebook paper or notecards for notetaking 
  7.	A place to play
  8.	Time to play (75 minutes)
  9.	These rules

## Preparing for the Game
  1.	The referee will split their class into equal teams, if possible. 
  2.	Each team needs to elect its leader. If they cannot decide on who should be the leader, the referee should have them roll three (3) six-sided dice. Whoever rolls the highest is the leader. Ties are rerolled until a higher roll result. 
  3.	Each team is assigned an organization or entity they will roleplay during the game session.
  4.	The day before the roleplaying session, players (i.e., students) will be assigned preparatory materials to read and/or research to conduct before the RPG session. Encourage players to work with their teammates to prepare for the RPG session.
