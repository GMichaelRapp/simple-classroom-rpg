## Welcome
This is a very light-weight roleplaying game to help students form into micro-cohorts, problem solve, develop critical thinking, and tackle important content-specific concepts. The idea first came from a very real realization in the classroom: Students don't engage with traditional lecture formats. So, to help students get away from lecture burnout, this simple roleplaying game was developed. This game is licensed under the **CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 International license** (see tabs above for details). You are free to tweak, break, or rewrite what you find here. Remember to give credit where credit is due.
