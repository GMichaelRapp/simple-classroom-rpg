## Welcome
This is a very light-weight roleplaying game to help students form into micro-cohorts, problem solve, develop critical thinking, and tackle important content-specific concepts. The idea firs came from a very real need to help students get away from lecture burnout. This game is licensed under the **CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 International license** (see tabs above for details).
